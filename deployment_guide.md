## üöÄ Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Streamlit Cloud account (free at share.streamlit.io)
- Your `skindisease.h5` model file

### Quick Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Upload to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - SkinAI app"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/skinai-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Click "New app"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Main file path: `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy!"

### Important Files for GitHub

Make sure you have these files in your repository:
- `app.py` - Main application
- `skindisease.h5` - Your trained model (must be in root directory)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `model_utils.py` - Model utilities
- `doctor_scraper.py` - Doctor scraping functionality
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration

## üìÅ Repository Structure for GitHub

```
skinai-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                    # Main Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skindisease.h5           # Your trained model (REQUIRED)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model_utils.py          # Model utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doctor_scraper.py       # Doctor scraping
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml         # Streamlit configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore             # Git ignore file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This documentation
```

## üîß Local Testing (Optional)

If you want to test locally before deploying:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skinai-app.git
cd skinai-app

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
streamlit run app.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Deployment

### Model File
- **CRITICAL**: Your `skindisease.h5` file must be in the root directory
- The app is configured to automatically load this model
- File size limit on GitHub: 100MB (if larger, use Git LFS)

### GitHub Large File Storage (if model > 100MB)
```bash
# If your model is larger than 100MB
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.h5"
git add .gitattributes
git add skindisease.h5
git commit -m "Add large model file with LFS"
git push
```

### Streamlit Cloud Limits
- **Memory**: 1GB RAM limit
- **Storage**: Limited temporary storage
- **Processing**: CPU-only (no GPU)
- **Timeout**: 10-minute request timeout

## üêõ Troubleshooting Streamlit Cloud

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Model Not Found Error**
   - Ensure `skindisease.h5` is in the repository root
   - Check file is properly committed to GitHub
   - Verify file path in code matches exact filename

2. **Memory Issues**
   ```python
   # If model is too large, you might need model optimization
   # Consider using TensorFlow Lite for smaller models
   ```

3. **Package Installation Errors**
   - Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are compatible
   - Remove version numbers if conflicts occur
   - Use the provided `requirements.txt` as-is

4. **Timeout Errors**
   - Streamlit Cloud has 10-minute timeout
   - Optimize model loading with caching
   - The app uses `@st.cache_resource` for efficiency

### App Not Loading?
Check these:
- ‚úÖ Repository is public or you've given Streamlit access
- ‚úÖ `app.py` exists in root directory
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` is properly formatted
- ‚úÖ `skindisease.h5` is in the repository
- ‚úÖ All Python syntax is correct
